    "ground_truth": "Autorefrigeration is more efficient because: 1) Zero temperature difference between reaction mass and refrigerant (direct vaporization from reaction mass), 2) Indirect effluent refrigeration requires a finite temperature difference for heat transfer across tubes necessitating lower refrigeration temperatures, 3) Lower refrigerant temperature requires lower compressor suction pressure resulting in higher compressor energy requirements, 4) Effluent refrigeration requires additional mixing power to overcome pressure drop across heat-transfer tubes, 5) The additional heat of mixing must also be removed increasing refrigeration duty.",

This is because mercaptan sulfur reacts with sulfuric acid to form sulfonic acid and water (acid-soluble compounds) plus sulfur dioxide: RSH + 3H₂SO₄ → RSO₃H + 3H₂O + 3SO₂.
